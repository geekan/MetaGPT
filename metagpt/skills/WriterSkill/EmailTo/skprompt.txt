Hi Toby,

The story of Macbeth
My name is Macbeth. I used to be King of Scotland, but I died. My wife's name is Lady Macbeth and we were married for 15 years. We had no children. Our beloved dog Toby McDuff was a famous hunter of rats in the forest.
My story was immortalized by Shakespeare in a play.

Thanks,
Dexter

1. MetaGPT takes a **one line requirement** as input and outputs **user stories / competitive analysis / requirements / data structures / APIs / documents, etc.**
2. Internally, MetaGPT includes **product managers / architects / project managers / engineers.** It provides the entire process of a **software company along with carefully orchestrated SOPs.**
   1. `Code = SOP(Team)` is the core philosophy. We materialize SOP and apply it to teams composed of LLMs.

## MetaGPT's Abilities


https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT/assets/34952977/34345016-5d13-489d-b9f9-b82ace413419



## Examples (fully generated by GPT-4)

For example, if you type `python startup.py "Design a RecSys like Toutiao"`, you would get many outputs, one of them is data & api design

![Jinri Toutiao Recsys Data & API Design](docs/resources/workspace/content_rec_sys/resources/data_api_design.png)

It costs approximately **$0.2** (in GPT-4 API fees) to generate one example with analysis and design, and around **$2.0** for a full project.




## Installation

### Installation Video Guide

- [Matthew Berman: How To Install MetaGPT - Build A Startup With One Prompt!!](https://youtu.be/uT75J_KG_aY)

### Traditional Installation

```bash
# Step 1: Ensure that NPM is installed on your system. Then install mermaid-js. (If you don't have npm in your computer, please go to the Node.js offical website to install Node.js https://nodejs.org/ and then you will have npm tool in your computer.)
npm --version
sudo npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

# Step 2: Ensure that Python 3.9+ is installed on your system. You can check this by using:
python --version

# Step 3: Clone the repository to your local machine, and install it.
git clone https://github.com/geekan/metagpt
cd metagpt
pip install -e.
```

**Note:**

- If already have Chrome, Chromium, or MS Edge installed, you can skip downloading Chromium by setting the environment variable
  `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD` to `true`.

- Some people are [having issues](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid.cli/issues/15) installing this tool globally. Installing it locally is an alternative solution,

  ```bash
  npm install @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
  ```

- don't forget to the configuration for mmdc in config.yml

  ```yml
  PUPPETEER_CONFIG: "./config/puppeteer-config.json"
  MMDC: "./node_modules/.bin/mmdc"
  ```

- if `pip install -e.` fails with error `[Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/test-easy-install-13129.write-test'`, try instead running `pip install -e. --user`

- To convert Mermaid charts to SVG, PNG, and PDF formats. In addition to the Node.js version of Mermaid-CLI, you now have the option to use Python version Playwright, pyppeteer or mermaid.ink for this task.

  - Playwright
    - **Install Playwright**

    ```bash
    pip install playwright
    ```

    - **Install the Required Browsers**

    to support PDF conversion, please install Chrominum.

    ```bash
    playwright install --with-deps chromium
    ```

    - **modify `config.yaml`**

    uncomment MERMAID_ENGINE from config.yaml and change it to `playwright`

    ```yaml
    MERMAID_ENGINE: playwright
    ```

  - pyppeteer
    - **Install pyppeteer**

    ```bash
    pip install pyppeteer
    ```

    - **Use your own Browsers**

    pyppeteer alow you use installed browsers,  please set the following envirment
    
    ```bash
    export PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH = /path/to/your/chromium or edge or chrome
    ```

    please do not use this command to install browser, it is too old

    ```bash
    pyppeteer-install
    ```

    - **modify `config.yaml`**

    uncomment MERMAID_ENGINE from config.yaml and change it to `pyppeteer`

    ```yaml
    MERMAID_ENGINE: pyppeteer
    ```

  - mermaid.ink
    - **modify `config.yaml`**

    uncomment MERMAID_ENGINE from config.yaml and change it to `ink`

    ```yaml
    MERMAID_ENGINE: ink
    ```  

    Note: this method does not support pdf export.

### Installation by Docker

```bash
# Step 1: Download metagpt official image and prepare config.yaml
docker pull metagpt/metagpt:v0.3.1
mkdir -p /opt/metagpt/{config,workspace}
docker run --rm metagpt/metagpt:v0.3.1 cat /app/metagpt/config/config.yaml > /opt/metagpt/config/key.yaml
vim /opt/metagpt/config/key.yaml # Change the config

# Step 2: Run metagpt demo with container
docker run --rm \
    --privileged \
    -v /opt/metagpt/config/key.yaml:/app/metagpt/config/key.yaml \
    -v /opt/metagpt/workspace:/app/metagpt/workspace \
    metagpt/metagpt:v0.3.1 \
    python startup.py "Write a cli snake game"

# You can also start a container and execute commands in it
docker run --name metagpt -d \
    --privileged \
    -v /opt/metagpt/config/key.yaml:/app/metagpt/config/key.yaml \
    -v /opt/metagpt/workspace:/app/metagpt/workspace \
    metagpt/metagpt:v0.3.1

docker exec -it metagpt /bin/bash
$ python startup.py "Write a cli snake game"
```

The command `docker run ...` do the following things:

- Run in privileged mode to have permission to run the browser
- Map host directory `/opt/metagpt/config` to container directory `/app/metagpt/config`
- Map host directory `/opt/metagpt/workspace` to container directory `/app/metagpt/workspace`
- Execute the demo command `python startup.py "Write a cli snake game"`

### Build image by yourself

```bash
# You can also build metagpt image by yourself.
git clone https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT.git
cd MetaGPT && docker build -t metagpt:custom .
```

## Configuration

- Configure your `OPENAI_API_KEY` in any of `config/key.yaml / config/config.yaml / env`
- Priority order: `config/key.yaml > config/config.yaml > env`

```bash
# Copy the configuration file and make the necessary modifications.
cp config/config.yaml config/key.yaml
```

| Variable Name                              | config/key.yaml                           | env                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| OPENAI_API_KEY # Replace with your own key | OPENAI_API_KEY: "sk-..."                  | export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."                  |
| OPENAI_API_BASE # Optional                 | OPENAI_API_BASE: "https://<YOUR_SITE>/v1" | export OPENAI_API_BASE="https://<YOUR_SITE>/v1" |

## Tutorial: Initiating a startup

```shell
# Run the script
python startup.py "Write a cli snake game"
# Do not hire an engineer to implement the project
python startup.py "Write a cli snake game" --implement False
# Hire an engineer and perform code reviews
python startup.py "Write a cli snake game" --code_review True
```

After running the script, you can find your new project in the `workspace/` directory.

### Preference of Platform or Tool

You can tell which platform or tool you want to use when stating your requirements.

```shell
python startup.py "Write a cli snake game based on pygame"
```
